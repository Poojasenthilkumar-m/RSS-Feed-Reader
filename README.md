# RSS-Feed-Reader
Create an RSS feed reader application using PHP and XML. The application should fetch RSS feeds from multiple sources, parse the XML data, and display the latest articles or posts to users. Allow users to subscribe to their favorite RSS feeds and customize the display settings, such as sorting by date or filtering by keyword.
